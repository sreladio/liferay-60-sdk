 * The model interface for the PhoneNumber service. Represents a row in the &quot;Z_PhoneNumber&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link prueba.model.impl.PhoneNumberImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a phone number model instance should use the {@link PhoneNumber} interface instead.
