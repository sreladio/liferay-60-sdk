 * The model interface for the USPhoneNumber service. Represents a row in the &quot;US_USPhoneNumber&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * <p>
 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.oldschool.user.registration.model.impl.USPhoneNumberImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 *
 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a u s phone number model instance should use the {@link USPhoneNumber} interface instead.
