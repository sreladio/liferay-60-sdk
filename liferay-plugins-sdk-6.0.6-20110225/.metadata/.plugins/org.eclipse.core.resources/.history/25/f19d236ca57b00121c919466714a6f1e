 * The model interface for the PohoneNumber service. Represents a row in the &quot;Z_PohoneNumber&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.

 * Never modify this interface directly. Add methods to {@link com.z.registration.model.impl.PohoneNumberImpl} and rerun ServiceBuilder to automatically copy the method declarations to this interface.

 * <p>
 * Never reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a pohone number model instance should use the {@link PohoneNumber} interface instead.
