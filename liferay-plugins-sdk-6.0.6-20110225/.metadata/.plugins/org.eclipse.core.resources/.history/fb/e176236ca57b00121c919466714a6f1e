/**
 * The base model interface for the Member service. Represents a row in the &quot;Z_Member&quot; database table, with each column mapped to a property of this class.
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface and its corresponding implementation {@link com.z.registration.model.impl.MemberModelImpl} exist only as a container for the default property accessors generated by ServiceBuilder. Helper methods and all application logic should be put in {@link com.z.registration.model.impl.MemberImpl}.

 * Never modify or reference this interface directly. All methods that expect a member model instance should use the {@link Member} interface instead.
